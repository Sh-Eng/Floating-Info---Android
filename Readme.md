Floating Info
=========

Floating Info is an Android application that displays the following in a system overlay window:

* The application name, package name and process id of the application which is currently in the device's foreground
* The Global CPU utilisation with a per-core breakdown - This is not foreground application specific.
* Memory usage breakdown for the currently foregrounded process (read the [notes](#notes) for the caveats).
* Network information like connection type, proxy status and IP addresses. Both IPv4 and IPv6
* Device Locale Information

## Limitations
Since Nougat it is not possible to get the process id of an app different than the one making the request.
As a result it no longer possible to get the memory utilisation of other applications.

SE Linux can interfere with getting CPU information as files in the /proc/ folder may not be globally readable.

* 2.0: Conversion to Android Studio, Lollipop support, network info, onboarding
* 2.1: Added Locale info, Oreo support

# <a name="notes"></a> Notes and Caveats
* The application will show the memory allocation of the currently foregrounded process which it gets by getting the Process Id of the currently foregrounded activity. This means that if an application has spawned multiple processes, this application will only show the memory utilisation of the main process.
* The Memory information displayed come via a [Debug.MemoryInfo](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.MemoryInfo.html) object, while using reflection to expose a number of hidden [fields](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/os/Debug.java).
* Data updates happen approximately every 1 second.

# Android Memory Usage
Memory management on Android is pretty complex and the easiest way to get started with understanding it is reading [this](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-memory.html) article - especially the "Viewing Overall Memory Allocations" section.
