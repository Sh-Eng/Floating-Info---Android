Floating Info
=========

Floating Info is an Android application that displays the following in a system overlay window:

* The application name, package name and process id of the application which is currently in the device's foreground
* The Global CPU utilisation with a per-core breakdown - This is not foreground application specific.
* Memory usage breakdown for the currently foregrounded process (read the [notes](#notes) for the caveats).

# <a name="notes"></a> Notes and Caveats
* The application will show the memory allocation of the currently foregrounded process which it gets by getting the Process Id of the currently foregrounded activity. This means that if an application has spawned multiple processes, this application will only show the memory utilisation of the main process.
* The Memory information displayed come via a [Debug.MemoryInfo](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.MemoryInfo.html) object, while using reflection to expose a number of hidden [fields](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/os/Debug.java).
* Data updates happen approximately every 1 second.
